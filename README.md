# CCIE-SP-V4.1
CCIE-SP-V4.1 random lab generator

The goal is this project is to create a random mock CCIE-SP configuration section based on the CCIE-SP blueprint (https://learningcontent.cisco.com/cln_storage/text/cln/marketing/exam-topics/400-201_ccieSP.pdf) each time the user runs the program.

*NOTE* The Last day for a v4.0 lab attempt is June 20th 2017, the new blueprint is here and I will be adding the tasks associated with this blueprint. (https://learningcontent.cisco.com/cln_storage/text/cln/marketing/exam-topics/400-201-ccie-sp-unified.pdf)

The VIRL topology will be uploaded to this GIT upon completion of the program to allow the user to load the VIRL topology, randomize the lab and then begin studying.

Not all lab tasks will be covered in this program but will be considered for furtuer additions or future programs using a seperate topology.

The main goals of this project are:

1. finish all sections of the blueprint and add rich tasks for a real 4.5 hour mock lab (assume the worst).
2. complete a few of the mock labs and edit tasks where needed to make them cleaner (or if i find V image limitations).
3. trim the fat and create a 1.5-2 hour "core" random lab where the tasks will be less of nature but more focused around speed and core knowledge.
4. some of the completed labs will be saved completed and then have errors injected with maybe 3-5 "tickets" for a mock tshoot section.
