# CCIE-SP-V4
CCIE-SP-V4 random lab generator

The goal is this project is to create a random mock CCIE-SP configuration section based on the CCIE-SP blueprint (https://learningcontent.cisco.com/cln_storage/text/cln/marketing/exam-topics/400-201_ccieSP.pdf) each time the user runs the program.

The output of the file however can be changed by editing the "c" variable to the class of output the user would like.

The VIRL topology will be uploaded to this GIT upon completion of the program to allow the user to load the VIRL topology, randomize the lab and then begin studying.

Not all lab tasks will be covered in this program but will be considered for furtuer additions or future programs using a seperate topology.
